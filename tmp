Dear PTA/PTO President,

It’s easy to see why dozens of Parent Teacher organizations throughout the XXXX area participate in our fundraising program – It generates substan tial funds and there’s almost no work for you to do.  

Here’s how it works:

We offer a 5 - week program entitled “Skills for School” in which children develop focus, perseverance, and learn how to set and attain goals.  We also cover child safety and teach basic non - aggressive self defense skills.  Groups meet twice a week in one hour sessions at our nearby facility .  The total price of the program is $75 including a martial arts uniform.  And 100% of funds raised go directly to your organization.  We provi de you with as many fliers as you’d like to promote the program.  

Your fliers are customized to make it clear that all funds raised go to support your organization.  I’ve enclosed a sample flier so you can see exactly what they will look like.

All you nee d to do is distribute the fliers through send - home packets and/or at events.  We take care of everything else.

When parents enroll their children, they make their checks payable to your organization.  We collect the checks and forward them to you.  That’s it.  No money for you to collect, no orders for you to fill.  Just cash the checks when they come in.  

Local PTAs and PTOs have raised thousands of dollars through this program.  We ha ve been helping children improve their lives since XXXX .  Pa rents and teachers frequently speak of the beneficial effects that (your school) has had in school performance, self - esteem, and general attitude.

Please contact me at (your phone) and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have and arrange for yo u to get as many fliers as you need. 

Sincerely
